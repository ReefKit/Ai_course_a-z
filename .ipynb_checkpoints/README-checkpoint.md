# Personal Machine Learning Project

This repository contains projects for learning and experimenting with machine learning concepts. The focus is on reinforcement learning using deep Q-learning and convolutional learning, implemented with Python and Gymnasium.

## Projects

### 1. Lunar Landing Simulation
- **Objective:** Train an agent to successfully land a lunar module using deep Q-learning.
- **Environment:** Gymnasium's LunarLander environment.
- **Approach:** Use deep Q-networks to optimize the agent's decision-making process to land lunar module safely.

### 2. Pac-Man AI
- **Objective:** Develop an AI agent that plays Pac-Man using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
- **Environment:** Gymnasium-based simulation.
- **Approach:** Implement convolutional learning to process visual data and train the agent to achieve high scores by avoiding ghosts and collecting points.

## Features
- Jupyter Notebook setup.
- Used remote computer for its good GPU.
- Reinforcement learning implementation with PyTorch.
- Pre-configured environments using Gymnasium.
